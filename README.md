# Integration Configurations Repository

Welcome to the Integration Configurations repository! This repository contains integration configuration files (`integrate.yml`) for various packages, designed to be used with the "react-native-integrate" tool. These configuration files help streamline the process of integrating packages into your React Native projects.

## What's Inside

Each package integration has its own directory containing the `integrate.yml` configuration file. These files outline the necessary steps and settings for integrating the respective packages.
